# LLM Cognition
Development of an interactive tool using Streamlit that enables Model Evaluation team to evaluate the performance of OpenAI models against the test cases

## Problem Statement
The project aims to evaluate the comprehension capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4o. This evaluation framework is inspired by the General AI Assistant (GAIA) dataset and benchmark, developed by researchers at Meta AI, Hugging Face, and AutoGPT. The Streamlit application facilitates a user-friendly experience, allowing users to assess model responses, modify metadata steps if necessary, and provide feedback on the model’s performance.

## Project Goals
### 1. Database - ETL 
- Objective: Extract data from Hugging Face GAIA benchmark dataset, formatting the textual data, loading it into the database, and loading all files into a bucket
- Tools: For extraction of data from hugging face - huggingface_hub downloader, for storage - MySQL database, for file storage - Google Cloud Storage bucket
- Output: Structured database in MySQL with all gaia_features, and gaia_annotations columns, formatted files stored in the google cloud storage bucket

### 2. Fast API
- Objective: The FastAPI application serves as an abstraction layer that hides all application processing, API calls to OpenAI, fetching data from MySQL database, downloading files from Google Cloud Storage Bucket.
- Tools: MySQL database connector for interfacing with MySQL database, Google Cloud connector for downloading files from Google Cloud, OpenAI package for interacting with GPT (for text based content) and Whisper (for audio based content), tiktoken library for counting the number of tokens, PyPDF2 library for extracting content from PDF files, Base64 library for encoding images to text, openpyxl library for parsing MS Excel spreadsheets, docx library for parsing MS Word documents, dotenv library for setting environment variables, and json library for parsing json content.
- Output: FastAPI ensures the response is always in a JSON format with HTTP status, message (response content), type (data type of response content), and additional fields (if needed)

### 3. Streamlit
- Objective: To provide a user-friendly interface for validating GPT model responses by allowing users to compare generated responses with validation inputs, edit annotator steps, and provide feedback.
- Tools: Streamlit (web application framework), Pandas (data manipulation), Matplotlib (visualization), NumPy (numerical computations), Requests (API calls for data fetching and sending).
- Output: The Search Engine Page features a query input and result display; the Validation Page allows users to compare GPT responses and provide feedback; the Analytics Page presents user data with visualizations of cost efficiency and operational metrics.

## Data Source
1. GAIA benchmark dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaia-benchmark/GAIA

## Prerequisites
Software Installations required for the project
1. Python Environment
A Python environment allows you to create isolated spaces for your Python projects, managing dependencies and versions separately.

2. Libraries
This assignment requires mutliple python libraries for data manipulation, API interactions, and web development like streamlit, huggingface_hub, pandas, matplotlib, mysql-connector-python.
To download all the the required libraries for the project run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
   
3. Visual Studio Code

4. Docker
 Docker allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent environments across different platforms

5. Google Cloud Platform
Google Cloud Storage is used for efficient storage of files

6. AWS
AWS can be utilized for various cloud services, including storage (Amazon S3)


8. Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source app framework that allows you to create interactive web applications easily.

9. MySQL Database
Relational database management system that allows you to store and manage data efficiently
